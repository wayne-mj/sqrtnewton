# sqrtnewton

This is a rewrite of a REXX script that I came across similar to the one on Wikipedia [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx) to find the square root of a positive number.

I have modified the code to include:
- Correct for negative numbers
- Set a limit for iterations
- Set tolerances for 32, 64 and 128 bit REAL numbers

This all came about as I am doing some courses on using the z/OS and writing code in REXX is one of the course modules.
